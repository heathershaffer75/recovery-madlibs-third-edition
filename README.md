# Recovery Mad Libs 3 — Third Edition

A **funny, recovery‑friendly, large‑group Mad Libs activity** designed for inpatient and residential treatment settings.  
Built to work smoothly with **20–30+ patients**, minimal facilitation, and maximum laughter.

This version is **longer, punchier, and more absurd** than previous editions — while staying clinically safe and group‑room appropriate.

## 🧠 How to Run It in Group

**Suggested flow (20–30 minutes):**
1. Pick one story
2. Ask the group to shout out answers (or popcorn style)
3. Use 🎲 Random Fill when energy dips
4. Generate and read aloud
5. Optional reflection:
   - “What part felt most accurate?”
   - “What actually *is* a skill hiding in the chaos?”

**Facilitator tip:**  
Let the humor do the work. Don’t over‑process it.
